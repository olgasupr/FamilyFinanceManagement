Outstanding known issues:
==========================



Visual issues:
	1.  all pages:  Make arrows nicer on the Month switcher
	2.  all pages:  edit income says "Please enter your family's income per month:"
			Better if it said "Please enter your family's income for September 2022:"
	3.  home page:  "Your family's recent spending" should say "Your family's spending for September 2022"
	4.  home page:  "Last month's analysis" should say "Analysis for September 2022"
	5.  spending page:  modal:  make the modal not have scrollbar
	6.  FIXED	spending page:  modal:  make the style of dropdown better
	7.  FIXED	spending page:  modal:  number-format the amount box
	8.  home page:  sort the spending by date (?)
	9.  home page:  only return the last 15(?) rows for spending (?)
	10.  spending page:  table has fonts that are too small
	11.  home page - format analysis as percentages, round off actuals and maybe targets

	
Other issues:
	1.  FIXED 	all pages:  Links in navbar should include the month
	2.  FIXED 	home page:  ADD MORE  on income missing yyyymm parameter
	3.  FIXED 	home page:  VIEW ANALYSIS on income missing yyyymm parameter
	4.  all pages:  edit income --> submit  always leads to home, should lead to source page
	5.  FIXED 	database:  ??drop within_income column from target_spending
			what does this column mean?
			how can we perform analysis with this?
	6.  FIXED 	spending page:  modal:  when incomplete info supplied, and click submit, error occurs.
	7.  FIXED	home page:  modal:  when nothing typed into input, error occurs.
	
	
To implement generally
	1.  DONE	Populate the target percentages to database
	2.  DONE 	home page:  populate analysis table
	3.  Analysis page:
		- SpendingCategory (categoryName, а description когда hover)
		- Target %  (из таблицы target_spending)
		- TargetAmount = Target % * Income
		- Actual % =  ActualAmount / Income
		- ActualAmount = (из таблицы actual_spending)
		- Excess % = Actual % - Target %
		- ExcessAmount = ActualAmount - TargetAmount
	4.  ASKED OLGA L	Implement SpendingService.getAllSpendingCategories(), SpendingService.getAllTargetSpending(), SpendingService.getSavingsSpendingCategory()
	5.  DONE	spending page:  Populate dropdown using SpendingService.getAllSpendingCategories()
	6.  DONE	AnalysisService and Analysis
	7.  home page:  populate evaluation for analysis
